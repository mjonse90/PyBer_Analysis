# PyBer Ride Sharing Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to report on data findings from January 2019 to early May 2019 to the CEO of PyBer. We conducted studies on ridership and fare metrics from different city types in which PyBer operates (urban, suburban, and rural). By creating a visualization of the data, we hope to provide PyBer with a better understanding of their ride sharing service and where improvements can be made in underserved areas.
